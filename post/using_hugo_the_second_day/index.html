        <p>I am in the country side this weekend. Internet access has been non-existent, except for a few messages that managed to get through. It seems like a good situation to test my new blogging workflow and make sure it works for me in different situations. You never know where inspiration will find you.</p>

<p>Last week I decided to experiment with building my blog with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. The first day when you install <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> on your machine, you are likely to follow the <a href="https://gohugo.io/overview/quickstart/">Quickstart Guide</a> in the Getting Started Section. It is pretty good and it builds a solid base in which to stand on.</p>

<p>Today, with limited time to work on this, without being able to browse <a href="https://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/">Hugo.io&rsquo;s documentation</a>, and not wanting to spend that time reading the CLI help section, I am going to write how to come back the second day and write a post without much fus.</p>

<p>Thankfully, I made some notes about my first encounter on a Quiver app notebook that will come handy.</p>

<p>First, we open our Terminal window and head over to our site directory.</p>

<p><code>cd SITE_NAME</code></p>

<p>Once there in its main directory, we run the command that starts a new draft post for us.</p>

<p><code>hugo new post/NAME_OF_YOUR_POST.md</code></p>

<p>This new draft post is generated in the subdirectory content and nowhere else. You then need to edit it there to include content, tags, categories and/ or whatever else your theme supports. I used nano but you can open it on your text editor if you like that more.</p>

<p>To see the draft in action, run:</p>

<p><code>hugo server --theme=NAME_OF_YOUR_THEME --buildDrafts</code></p>

<p>Once you are ready to generate your public site with this new post, you can either edit the header section of your post with:</p>

<p><em>draft = false</em></p>

<p>OR you can run the following command back in the project&rsquo;s home directory before generating the blog:</p>

<p><code>hugo undraft content/post/NAME_OF_YOUR_POST.md</code></p>

<p>After doing one or the other, we are ready to build our site. The output will go in our public directory.
Run the following:</p>

<p><code>hugo --theme=NAME_OF_YOUR_THEME</code></p>

<p>And we are done. Now we just need an internet connection to send this to our hosting solution. :)
In my case, after following the quickstart guide, I decided to host it on GitHub for now. It works great.</p>
